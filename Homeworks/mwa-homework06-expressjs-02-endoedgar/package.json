  "description": "Create an Express application that implements a Restful Stateless API for an entity called `students` as following: ```javascript const students = [{id: 1, name: \"Asaad Saad\", course: \"CS572\", picture: \"1570286884.jpg\", grade: 95}] ``` * Take into consideration that `students` entity is an immutable data structure. * Write routes for the following CRUD operations and use the proper HTTP verbs (`GET` one and all, `POST`, and `DELETE`). * Test with `HTTP Client` extension for VSCode. * Your API accepts and returns `JSON` data. * Log all requests to a file `access.log` using `morgan` middleware.  * For your `POST` route, assign a middleware to upload the student's picture into a directory `./assets/pics`, only `.jpg` files should be accepted and picture size should not exceed `3 MB`, files should be renamed to represent Unix timestamps. * For your `POST` route, assign a custom middleware to verify if a user passes a `JSON` object that contains `id`, `name`, `course` and `grade`, otherwise send back an error. * Define a middleware to serve all static images of `./picture/*` from `./assets/pics/*`. * Accept all cross-domain XHR requests using `cors` middleware.",
